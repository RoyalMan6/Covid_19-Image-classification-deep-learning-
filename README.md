# Covid-19: Deep learning Image Classification task
 
We classify chest X-ray images with Covid, normal and pneumonia using CNN and transfer learning. Given the small dataset, we use k-fold cross validation for training the model, reaching accuracies of ~97% on the test data. We also construct a confusion matrix and P-R curve.
